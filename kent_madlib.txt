Once upon a time there was a {type_of_creature} that could {verb} and was made of {substance}.  
It was very {feeling_adjective} because {group_of_people} thought that they could {verb} with it and that it would be useful for {activity}.  
One day, {person's_title} decided that it should be illegal to {direct_verb} these creatures, so {group_of_people} were all {past-tense_punishment} 
for {duration_of_time} or until they {past-tense_verb}.  
If I ever met one of these creatures, I would {verb} until I was {physical_condition_adjective}.
